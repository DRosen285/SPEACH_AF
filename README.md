# SPEACH_AF

Sampling Protein Ensembles and Conformational Heterogeneity with Alphafold2


## Files
SPEACH_AF_scan (jupyter notebook): will generate modified MSA files (alanine mutagenesis) based on an initial MSA and PDB

batch.py: modified batch.py (original from Colabfold branched on 12/2022). <br>
  use in either two ways 
1. install ColabFold from https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold as described and replace the installed batch.py <br>
   (located in anaconda3/lib/python3.X/site-packages/colabfold or miniconda3/lib/python3.X/site-packages/colabfold) <br>
2. install a branched ColabFold (branched on 12/2022) which has the modified file
```
pip install "colabfold[alphafold] @ git+https://github.com/RSvan/ColabFold"
```
